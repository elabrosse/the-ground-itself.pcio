## Getting started
1. Download [`the-ground-itself.pcio`](/the-ground-itself.pcio?raw=true) file to your filesystem
2. Follow the room import instructions at https://playingcards.io/docs/room-import-export
3. Import the pcio file into playingcards.io
4. Create the room and share its URL with your friends

## Room mechanics
The **Reset** button at the top left resets the room for a fresh start. It recalls all cards, shuffles the deck, and prepares the two necessary stacks.

The **Deal** button automatically distributes face cards to sitting players. Wait until all players have joined the room and are sitting in a player slot on the left before dealing cards so that everyone gets their share of face cards.

A **six-sided die** is available at the top.

A **red chip** at the top right can be used to request a break. It serves the purpose of the coin referred to in the game instructions.

On the left is the **stack of faces**. These cards are automatically distributed to sitting players with the **Deal** button and doesn't necessarily need to be interacted with. Immediately on its right are card holders for face cards to be stacked, face up.

In the middle is the **stack of numbers**. As the game progresses players can freely pick cards from it and place them, face up, in their respective card holders on the right. Each card stack conveniently displays the number of cards that it contains for quick reference to the corresponding _card meanings_ of the game rules. For example, as shown in the screenshot, a "3" next to the _stack of eights_ relates to the **3rd entry** under **EIGHTS** from the _card meanings_.

## Customizing
The room can be customized manually after import. Rooms can also be copied, or exported as `pcio`, from the _Room Options_ panel in _Edit Mode_. Refer to the _playingcards.io_ documentation at https://playingcards.io/docs for more details.

Enjoy!
