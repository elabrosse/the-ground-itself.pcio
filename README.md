## Getting started
1. Download [`the-ground-itself.pcio`](/the-ground-itself.pcio?raw=true) file to your filesystem
2. Navigate to the room import page at https://playingcards.io/import
3. Import the pcio file into playingcards.io
4. Create the room and share its URL with your friends to get started

## Room mechanics
The **Start over** button at the top left resets the room. It recalls all cards, shuffles the deck, and prepares the two necessary stacks.

The **Deal** button automatically distributes face cards to sitting players.

A single dice is available at the top.

A red chip at the top right can be used to request a break. It serves the purpose of the coin referred to in the game instructions.

The empty card holder in the middle of the room is for everyone to place cards, face up, one at a time.

On the right is the initial stack of face cards. That one is automatically distributed to sitting players and doesn't need to be interacted with.

On the left is the stack of numbers. Players can pick cards from it and place them in the middle card holder as the game progresses.

## Customizing
The room can be customized manually after import. Refer to the playingcards.io documentation.

Enjoy!
